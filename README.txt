Description

    A spare plain text editor for android demonstrates file management
    on android-23.  Employs "external" or "internal" storage according
    to availability.

Status

    Demo.

Operation

    Creates a directory "/syntelos/" under which it edits plain text
    files.  

    Open a (new) file using "path/filename" syntax from the open
    dialog.

Notes

    The 'Reference' class demonstrates how 'File' and 'Uri' are
    employed in a file I/O strategy.

    The 'Syntelos' class demonstrates how android permissions are
    employed to enabl file I/O.

    The 'Editor' class demonstrates the operation of these ideas.
